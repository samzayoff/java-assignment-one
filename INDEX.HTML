            <p>The task involves gathering student information â€“ their name, ID, and scores in three subjects: HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript. We'll then process this data to determine their overall score and performance
            level. The individual inputs will be echoed back in the browser's developer console for verification.
            Finally, a summary of their total score and percentage will be presented both within the console and
            through a pop-up message to the user.</p>
