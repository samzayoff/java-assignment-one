            <p>This program is a student marks calculator designed to collect a student's name, roll number, and marks in five subjects: Web Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Python, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Database Management Systems. It ensures input validation by verifying that the name contains only letters and spaces, the roll number consists of only numbers, and the marks for each subject are numeric and within the range of 0 to 100. The program calculates the total marks obtained out of 500 and computes the percentage based on the total marks. Finally, it displays the student's name, roll number, marks in each subject, total marks, and percentage in an alert box and logs the same information to the console for debugging or further use.</p>
